            <p>
                Surprisingly, the application evaluation process is very similar for commercial business loans and home loans. 
                Banks and lenders will evaluate your revenue, existing debts, and credit history to assess your loan repayment capability.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the case of residential loans, your property is considered loan collateral and will therefore be appraised by a registered valuer. 
                Similarly, for commercial business loans, the bank or lender will closely inspect your business plan to determine the viability of the proposal.
            </p>

            <p>
                They will typically consider the following:

                What is the credit history of the business owner? Does he or she have a strong repayment track record?

             <p>
                A <strong>Business Loan</strong> is what bankers refer to as an unsecured loan, meaning there is no physical property mortgaged to secure the loan — unlike a home loan or commercial property loan.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given that most startups do not survive beyond their first few years, it is natural for lenders and banks to classify Business Loans as higher-risk financing.
            </p>

            <p>
                For these reasons, you will commonly see the following repayment terms:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>
                Business Loans typically carry interest rates that are 3% to 5% higher than standard home loans.
                </li>
                <li>
                Most Business Loans have a shorter repayment period of approximately 5 to 6 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                However, if you are willing to offer a residential property as security, you may qualify for an extended repayment period of up to 30 years.
